Description
***********

Pictures of objects belonging to 101 categories. About 40 to 800 images per
category. Most categories have about 50 images. Collected in September 2003 by
Fei-Fei Li, Marco Andreetto, and Marc'Aurelio Ranzato. The size of each image
is roughly 300 x 200 pixels. We have carefully clicked outlines of each object
in these pictures, these are included under the 'Annotations.tar'. There is
also a MATLAB script to view the annotations, 'show_annotations.m'.
